You walk into a theatre you're about to see a show in. The user within the theatre walks you to your row and mentions you're allowed to sit anywhere within the given row. Naturally you'd like to sit int the seat that gives you
the most space. You also would prefer this space to be evenly distributed on either side of you. 
Given the theatre row represented as an integer array, return the seat index of where you should sit.Ones represent occupied seats and zeroes represent empty seats.
You may assume that someone is always sitting in the first and last seat of the row. Whenever there are two equally goods, you should sit in the seat with the lower index. If there is no seat to sit in, return -1. The given 
array will always have a length of at least one and contain only ones and zeroes.

seats = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
sample output 4
